## APIs

From this [list of public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#weather), four candidates listed as providing historical data:

1. apilayer weatherstack
2. Micro Weather
3. Oikolab
4. Visual Crossing

They all require an API key.

### 1. apilayer weatherstack

250 calls/month for free

### 2. Micro Weather

Looks like they preivously had a free tier (their "solo" tier refers to it), but it's now called "dev" and wording is unclear whether it includes anything for free.

### 3. Oikolab

Free 1500 "units" / month (unclear if amt of data for a unit is entirety of a requested month's data, or just one request)

### 4. Visual Crossing

1000 records / day in free tier. Enough to get started!

Update: woof, this gets burned quick, when 1 record = 1 day.


## Temp

TODO: What is "feelslike"? Is it standardized? Should I use it instead?
